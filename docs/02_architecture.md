# PI Architecture

PI is designed to make the interface to data plane objects that can be
expressed in P4 uniform and independent of the instances of the
objects.

## P4 objects and APIs
To accomplish this, the API defines the following APIs:

### Tables

### Counters

### Meters

### Other externs


## Linking objects to APIs

How do we go from a P4 name to an the PI API

## Protobuf

## PI and PD

## Database and JSON

## Interoperation with target specific APIs
