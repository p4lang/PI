// This package and its contents are a work-in-progress.

// !!! This package is undergoing an update an is in a transition state !!!
// We are using a multi-stage approach as suggested by teverman:
// 1) Update P4Info to contain a preamble in the match key.  Leave full header
// field support in place for the time being.  Have p4c generate P4Info with
// the match key preambles. Commit to github.
// 2) Pull phase 1 changes to partner repos and adapt P4Info client code to
// operate with the new match key preamble, and then phase out dependencies on
// P4Info header fields.  Commit these changes to partner internal repose.
// 3) Remove header fields from P4Info, which should now no longer be
// referenced. Commit to github.
// 4) Pull phase 3 changes and confirm partner code is free of header field
// dependencies.

  // using these ids can detect if the wrong resource type is used

  // that uniquely indentifies the object. For example if the P4 program
  // contains two tables with paths s.c1.t and s.c2.t, the default aliases will
  // respectively be c1.t and c2.t. The P4 programmer may also override the
