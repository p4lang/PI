The Python file in this directory contains a example base class which can be
inherited from to write [PTF](https://github.com/p4lang/ptf) tests using the
P4Runtime gRPC API. The P4Runtime API is evolving rapidly and this code may be
out-of-sync. As the API becomes more stable, we will try to provide a stable
version of the P4RuntimeTest class as well.
