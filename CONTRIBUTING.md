### Apache CLA

All developers must sign the [P4.org](http://p4.org) CLA and return it to
(membership@p4.org) before making contributions. The CLA is available
[here](http://p4.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P4_Language_Consortium_Membership_Agreement.pdf).

### Building locally

We recommend that you build with a recent C/C++ compiler and with `-Werror` since
our CI tests use this flag.
